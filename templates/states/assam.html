        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/rice.jpg') }}" alt="Rice" class="crop-img">
           <p>Assam is one of the leading rice-producing states in India.Rice is a staple food and a major agricultural crop in Assam.
            Various varieties of rice, including aromatic varieties like "Assam Rice" and "Joha Rice," are cultivated in the fertile plains of the Brahmaputra Valley.
            Rice is grown through both rain-fed and irrigated cultivation methods. The state's abundant rainfall during the monsoon season supports rain-fed paddy cultivation, 
            while irrigation facilities are also utilized in some areas.
