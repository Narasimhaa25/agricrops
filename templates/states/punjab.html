        <p>
            <b>Prominence:</b> Punjab is one of the leading wheat-producing states in India, often called the "Wheat Bowl of India" due to its high productivity and contribution to national wheat production.<br>
            <b>Rabi Crop:</b> Wheat is predominantly grown as a Rabi crop (November–April), benefiting from cooler temperatures and adequate moisture.<br>
            <b>Varieties:</b> Popular varieties include HD-2967, PBW-343, HD-3086, and HD-2851.<br>
            <b>Cultivation Practices:</b> Land preparation, sowing, irrigation, fertilization, and pest management are standard. Zero tillage is gaining popularity.<br>
            <b>Irrigation:</b> Extensive canal and tube well irrigation support high yields.<br>
            <b>Crop Rotation:</b> Wheat is often rotated with rice, maize, and pulses.<br>
            <b>Government Support:</b> Subsidies, credit, crop insurance, and MSP procurement.<br>
            <b>Challenges:</b> Declining groundwater, soil degradation, pests, and climate change.

            <b>Varieties:</b> Both traditional and high-yielding types, with Basmati being especially popular.<br>
            <b>Irrigation:</b> Relies heavily on canal and tube well irrigation.<br>
            <b>Cultivation:</b> Land preparation, transplanting/direct sowing, irrigation, fertilization, and pest management.<br>
            <b>Government Support:</b> Subsidies, credit, crop insurance, and MSP.<br>
            <b>Challenges:</b> Groundwater decline, soil degradation, pests, and environmental concerns.
