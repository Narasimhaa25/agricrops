        <p>
                <p><b>Varieties:</b> Andhra Pradesh cultivates various rice varieties suited to its diverse agro-climatic conditions. Some popular rice varieties grown in the state include Sona Masuri, BPT 5204, Swarna, MTU 1010, and JGL 1798.

<p><b>Cultivation Practices:</b> Rice is primarily grown in both irrigated and rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh. In irrigated regions, rice is cultivated using techniques like transplanting and direct seeding, while in rainfed areas, it is grown using rainwater and conservation practices.

<p><b>Geographical Distribution:</b> Rice cultivation is widespread across Andhra Pradesh, with major rice-growing regions including the coastal districts of East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna, and Guntur, as well as the delta regions of the Godavari and Krishna rivers.

<p><b>Seasonality:</b> Rice cultivation in Andhra Pradesh follows a seasonal pattern, with the Kharif season (monsoon season) being the primary period for rice cultivation. The Rabi season (winter season) also sees some rice cultivation, particularly in irrigated areas.

<p><b>Irrigation:</b> Irrigation plays a crucial role in rice cultivation in Andhra Pradesh, with surface irrigation, canal irrigation, tube wells, and bore wells being common methods. The state government has also implemented various water management projects and schemes to improve irrigation facilities for rice farmers.

<p><b>Government Support:</b> The government of Andhra Pradesh provides various support measures to rice farmers, including subsidies on seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation equipment. Minimum support prices (MSPs) are also announced to ensure remunerative prices for rice farmers.

<p><b>Challenges</b> Rice cultivation in Andhra Pradesh faces challenges such as water scarcity, soil degradation, pest and disease outbreaks, and market fluctuations. Efforts are being made to address these challenges through sustainable farming practices, technology adoption, and policy interventions.

        <h2>Cotton</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/cotton.jpg') }}" alt="Cotton" class="crop-img">
        <p><b>Varieties:</b> Andhra Pradesh cultivates various cotton varieties suited to its agro-climatic conditions. Some popular cotton varieties grown in the state include Bt cotton varieties like Bollgard II, Bunny, RCH 2, and RCH 659.

<p><b>Cultivation Practices:</b> Cotton is primarily grown in rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh, with the Kharif season (monsoon season) being the main period for cotton cultivation. However, cotton is also cultivated in some irrigated regions using canal water, tube wells, and bore wells.

<p><b>Geographical Distribution:</b> Cotton cultivation is widespread across Andhra Pradesh, with major cotton-growing regions including the districts of Guntur, Prakasam, Krishna, Kurnool, Anantapur, and parts of Telangana region like Adilabad, Karimnagar, and Warangal.

<p><b>Irrigation: </b> rainfed cotton cultivation is common in Andhra Pradesh, supplemental irrigation may be provided in areas with insufficient rainfall or during dry spells to ensure optimal growth and yield. Drip irrigation and sprinkler systems are increasingly being adopted to conserve water and improve water use efficiency in cotton cultivation.

<p><b>Government Support:</b> The government of Andhra Pradesh provides various support measures to cotton farmers, including subsidies on seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation equipment. Minimum support prices (MSPs) are also announced to ensure remunerative prices for cotton farmers.

<p><b>Processing and Industry:</b> Cotton produced in Andhra Pradesh is processed in ginning mills to separate the cotton fiber from the seeds. The state also has textile industries that use cotton as a raw material for producing various cotton products like yarn, fabric, and garments, contributing to the state's economy and employment generation.

<p><b>Challenges:</b> Cotton cultivation in Andhra Pradesh faces challenges such as pest infestations (e.g., pink bollworm), weed management, soil fertility degradation, water scarcity, and market fluctuations. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, soil health management practices, and efficient water management techniques are being adopted to address these challenges.
