        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Gujarat has a strong agricultural base, and farmers engage in both food and cash crop cultivation.
            A little less than half of Gujarat districts are drought prone. Major Kharif crops in the state are cotton, groundnut, sesamum, castor, paddy, bajra, maize, tur, green gram, sugarcane etc. 
            and wheat, rice, maize, mustard, gram, groundnut, bajra etc are major Rabi crops.

        <h2>Cotton</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/cotton.JPG') }}" alt="Cotton" class="crop-img">
        <p>
            Cotton cultivation is a major agricultural activity in Gujarat, and the state is one of the leading producers of cotton in India.
            Gujarat plays a crucial role in India's overall cotton production. The state's favorable agro-climatic conditions make it well-suited for cotton cultivation.
            Cotton is primarily a Kharif season (monsoon season) crop in Gujarat. It is sown during the monsoon months of June to August and harvested from September to December.
            Gujarat's cotton production is closely linked to its textile industry. The state has numerous cotton ginning and pressing factories, spinning mills,
            and textile units that process the raw cotton into various textile products.

        <p>
            Groundnut, also known as peanut, is a significant crop in Gujarat, and the state is one of the leading producers of groundnuts in India.
            Groundnut is primarily a Kharif season (monsoon season) crop in Gujarat. Sowing typically takes place during the monsoon months of June to August, 
            and harvesting is done from September to November.
            Groundnut is often grown in rainfed conditions, utilizing the moisture received during the monsoon season. However, in some areas where irrigation is available, farmers may opt for 
            irrigated groundnut cultivation to ensure a consistent water supply.
            Groundnut seeds are rich in oil, and after harvest, the seeds are processed to extract groundnut oil.

            Great Millet is primarily a Kharif season (monsoon season) crop in Gujarat. It is sown during the onset of the monsoon, 
            typically from June to August, and harvested from September to November. Great Millet has diverse uses. It is a staple food in many parts of India, used for making rotis (flatbreads) and other food products.
            Additionally, it is utilized as fodder for livestock. Great Millet is rich in nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, and certain vitamins and minerals.
            Its cultivation supports food security and nutritional diversity.
