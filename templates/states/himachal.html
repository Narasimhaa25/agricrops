Barley is used as a food grain, fodder for livestock, and as a raw material for malt in the brewing industry. It is also used in traditional local cuisine. Barley cultivation in Himachal Pradesh relies mainly on rainfed conditions, but traditional and modern irrigation methods are also used in some areas.
