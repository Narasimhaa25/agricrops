        <p>
            Rice is cultivated across different regions of Meghalaya, with both upland and lowland varieties adapting to the diverse agro-climatic conditions. Meghalaya's climate, characterized by high rainfall and hilly terrain, is suitable for rice cultivation, allowing for both Kharif (monsoon) and Rabi (winter) crops. Upland rice is grown on sloping terrains, while lowland rice is cultivated in areas with better water availability, often using terraced fields. Traditional farming practices, including shifting (jhum) cultivation, are still followed in some areas. Rainfed rice is common, but supplemental irrigation is practiced in lowlands. Indigenous rice varieties contribute to local biodiversity and food security.
