            Wheat is a major cereal crop grown in Madhya Pradesh and plays a crucial role in the state's agriculture. Wheat is cultivated across various regions, with the northern and western parts being prominent wheat-producing areas. Sown in winter (October–December) and harvested in spring (March–April), both irrigated and rainfed wheat cultivation is practiced. Wheat is a staple food in India, and its cultivation in Madhya Pradesh contributes significantly to food security.
