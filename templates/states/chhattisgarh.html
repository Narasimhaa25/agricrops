However, the main cultivation season in Chhattisgarh aligns with the Kharif season, which spans from June to October. Sugarcane is cultivated in various districts of Chhattisgarh, especially in the plains and fertile river basins. Sugarcane requires a substantial amount of water for optimal growth, and in areas where rainfall may be insufficient, irrigation facilities are employed. Rivers and canals in Chhattisgarh support the irrigation needs of sugarcane cultivation. Besides sugar production, sugarcane in Chhattisgarh is also used for producing molasses, which is further processed to make ethanol.
